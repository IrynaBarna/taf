How to run transportation procedures from WRTM to SynapseRT:

Pre-install:

Make sure that TMCLI utilities are located in /opt/TMCLI.

1. Go to taf/plugins/connectors:
   $ cd $HOME/<git_project_path>/taf/plugins/connectors
   
2. Create there two sym-links:
   $ ln -s ../../utils/wrtm_export/transportation.py transportation.py
   $ ln -s ../../utils/wrtm_export/WRTM_export.py WRTM_export.py
   
3. Run transportation script:

   This script contains two main functions:
       - create_test_cases(wrtm, synapsert)
             transport all test cases from WRTM to SynapseRT;
             uncomment to enable in main() function;
             have to be run before create_test_plans() and only once.
              
       - create_test_plans(wrtm, synapsert, builds)
             transport all history (suites and sub-tests);
             uncomment to enable in main() function;
             have to be run after all cases were transported by create_test_cases().
             
   $ sudo python transportation.py
